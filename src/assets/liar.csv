But another wave is beginning. Nucor, Steel Dynamics Inc. (SDI), Chaparral, and Ipsco are boosting capital spending for the minimill sector this year and next by building new plate and structurals mills. U.S. minimills' capital spending will be $1.41 billion this year, up from $1.22 billion in 1997...Chaparral will build a $400 million structurals mill in Dinwiddie County, Va. Production is scheduled to begin in mid-1999. Nucor's plate mill in Hertford County, N.C., will cost $300 million and will produce 1 million annual tons. It will begin production in 2000. Nucor will complete other large projects by that time. A new $150 million structurals mill in Berkeley County will begin production this fall. A $120 million cold mill with a 500,000-annual-ton galvanizing line and 800,000-ton cold-rolling line in Hickman, Ark., will be installed by early next year...SDI will begin building a new, $285 million structurals mill in Whitley County, Ind., late this year.

While Environmental Protection Agency ethics official Kevin Minoli retroactively cleared Pruitt over the condo, saying that $50 per month adds up to a ""reasonable market value"" of $1,500 per month, he later issued a second statement saying he had not evaluated the ""actual use of the space""; the federal government's top ethics official, acting Office of Government Ethics director David Apol, then sent a letter to the EPA saying, ""Additional information has now come to light that calls into question whether the earlier determination that the administrator paid market value for the use he made of the apartment would still be valid."" Other parts of this tweet are also questionable. ""Somewhat"" is subjective, but Pruitt's security expenditures appear to be more than double those of his Obama-era predecessor. His security detail, which is reported to have 20 members, is more than three times the size of his predecessor's; over the first three months of his tenure, his security costs were more than double those of his predecessor over the same period, environmental publication E&E News reported. It is not clear what Trump was referring to when he said ""record clean air & water"" or ""saving USA billions of dollars."" Though the Environmental Protection Agency's assistant inspector general for investigations has said that there have been more threats against Pruitt than there were against his predecessors, nobody has released any proof: the EPA has told reporters that it does not have any documents on such threats, and nobody anywhere in the country has been arrested for making a threat against him.",Pruitt condo,no,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/982770847046922240,Trump White House,Scott Pruitt,,,Twitter,,,,

""The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016,"" the Nunes memo said.

Reports in the New York Times and elsewhere have revealed that Papadopoulos had boasted to an Australian diplomat that Russia had obtained damaging information on Clinton, before this was publicly known; the Australian diplomat had then passed on the information to U.S. officials. ""The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016,"" the Nunes memo says. With regard to Obama: even some members of the Obama administration take issue with Obama's quiet pre-election response to Russia's election meddling. It is certainly false, though, to suggest Obama didn't do anything at all. In December 2016, after the election, Obama expelled from the U.S. 35 Russian ""diplomats"" suspected of being spies, closed two Russian compounds he alleged were being used for intelligence purposes, and sanctioned Russian intelligence agencies and companies he alleged were providing support to Russian intelligence.",Investigation opened to discredit,Yes,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/970650759091163137,Russian ties,Barack Obama,US intelligence,,Twitter,,,,

Rather, he was citing his favourite morning show, Fox and Friends, which appeared to be citing the pro-Trump website Breitbart. But it was incorrect regardless. According to the polling firm Gallup, Trump's approval rating with Black Americans actually fell from 15 per cent to 6 per cent between January 2017 and December 2017, as the Washington Post noted. Recent polls from other firms put Trump's approval rating with Black Americans at a higher level -- 11 per cent in one poll, 12 per cent in another -- but still not even close to double his previous level. So where did Breitbart, Fox and Trump get this claim? They took data from the survey firm SurveyMonkey --  23 per cent Trump approval with black men, 11 per cent approval with Black women -- and simply averaged the figures for the two genders, settling on an ""approval rating"" of 17 per cent. Then they compared that 23 per cent number to Trump's 8 per cent performance with Black Americans in exit polls of the 2016 election. This is erroneous in two ways. First, you cannot properly compare approval rating polls to exit polls; exit polls do not show an approval rating but attempt to reflect how people voted. Second, it is bad math to take a simple average of a politician's male approval rating and female approval rating without considering how many of each were surveyed -- in this case, 19,000 Black men and 31,000 Black women.

More jobs were created during the same period in 2016, under Obama, than during the first 10 months of Trump's tenure: 1.78 million under Obama, 1.47 million under Trump, Washington Post economics reporter Heather Long noted. Trump presided over two consecutive quarters of 3 per cent economic growth, which is considered good, but as a Brookings Institution report in 2013 noted, the recessions of 1974-1975 and the early 1980s were followed by ""annual GDP growth around 5 per cent in 1976-78 and even higher in 1983-85.""

And that's why I think a lot of people turned on you and turned on a lot of other people. And that's why you have a 17 per cent approval rating, which is pretty bad.""","Saying ""you"" here, Trump wrongly conveys the impression that Muir himself has 17 per cent approval. In fact, there is no polling on Muir. Trump appears to have actually been referring to a 2016 poll about Americans' views on the media.

In terms of counties I think the most ever, or just about the most ever.""","Trump's victory was not close to one of the biggest of all time. He lost the popular vote, and his Electoral College margin ranks 46th out of 58 elections. Trump did far better in terms of counties, winning more than any candidate since Ronald Reagan, but he was well short of setting the record or even ""just about"" tying it: Richard Nixon won more than 2,950 counties in 1972, far exceeding Trump's 2,623.",Election victory size,Yes,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-abc-news-anchor-david-muir-interviews-president/story?id=45047602,Election,Exaggeration,,,Interviews,,,,

They say I had the biggest crowd in the history of inaugural speeches.""","""They"" can mean anyone, but no expert is declaring that Trump had the biggest inauguration crowd in history.

Trump's own lawyers said in a legal filing that ""all available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud.""

I've been on for 15 times this year. I don't think that's a record, Mike, that can ever be broken. Do you agree with that?""","Trump's numbers are well off. He has been on the cover 11 times, TIME told Politico, which is not even close to a record: Richard Nixon was on 55 covers.
