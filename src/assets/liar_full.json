Suniva announced in June that it is emerging from bankruptcy and will restart operations, but there is no indication it will open multiple plants. SolarWorld, meanwhile, sold its Oregon plant, but that plant continues to operate at only 50 per cent capacity, the Oregonian reported in June.

Trump's predecessors did not criminally prosecute as many parents-with-children as Trump's administration did under its new \"zero tolerance policy,\" but they did not simply allow these parents to proceed freely into the country rather than detain them. In many cases, the Obama administration sent their cases to civil immigration courts, which often resulted in deportation but not detention. Further, an Obama \"alternatives to detention\" program, cancelled by Trump, paired asylum seekers with social workers who helped them navigate the legal system and helped ensure they completed their required check-ins with immigration authorities. And under Obama and Trump, thousands of asylum seekers have been released with GPS ankle monitors that allows immigration authorities to monitor their whereabouts.",

While many patients objected to this requirement, which the new legislation removed, the FDA approved 99 per cent of all patient requests, the Trump-appointed head of the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb, testified to Congress in October 2017. The Government Accountability Office confirms: \"Of the nearly 5,800 expanded access requests that were submitted to FDA from fiscal year 2012 through 2015, FDA allowed 99 per cent to proceed,\" the GAO wrote in a July 2017 report. \"FDA typically responded to emergency single-patient requests within hours and other types of requests within the allotted 30 days.\" Further, the new legislation will not help the patients whose requests for experimental treatments have been rejected by drug companies themselves.

One of the four instances was a conversation with Comey; another one of the instances was an interview under oath with investigators in which he discussed a conversation he had with Comey. In both cases, McCabe was found to have \"lacked candor\" essentially because the inspector general believed Comey's account over McCabe's.

Contrary to Trump's repeated assertion, the U.S. has long been successful in WTO disputes: as his own Council of Economic Advisers said in a report in February, the U.S. has won 86 per cent of the cases it has brought to WTO adjudicators; the global average is 84 per cent, China's figure 67 per cent.

Pruitt has argued that his arrangement was \"like an Airbnb situation\" rather than a traditional apartment rental, but there are almost no $50-per-night Airbnb options in that area of the city, and certainly none that allow the visitor to repeatedly book the same high-quality apartment at their convenience on short notice. While Environmental Protection Agency ethics official Kevin Minoli retroactively cleared Pruitt over the condo, saying that $50 per month adds up to a \"reasonable market value\" of $1,500 per month, he later issued a second statement saying he had not evaluated the \"actual use of the space\"; the federal government's top ethics official, acting Office of Government Ethics director David Apol, then sent a letter to the EPA saying, \"Additional information has now come to light that calls into question whether the earlier determination that the administrator paid market value for the use he made of the apartment would still be valid.\" Other parts of this tweet are also questionable. \"Somewhat\" is subjective, but Pruitt's security expenditures appear to be more than double those of his Obama-era predecessor. His security detail, which is reported to have 20 members, is more than three times the size of his predecessor's; over the first three months of his tenure, his security costs were more than double those of his predecessor over the same period, environmental publication E&E News reported. It is not clear what Trump was referring to when he said \"record clean air & water\" or \"saving USA billions of dollars.\" Though the Environmental Protection Agency's assistant inspector general for investigations has said that there have been more threats against Pruitt than there were against his predecessors, nobody has released any proof: the EPA has told reporters that it does not have any documents on such threats, and nobody anywhere in the country has been arrested for making a threat against him.",

It was first proposed in 2009, and it is a project to replace an existing 2.25-mile section of wall, not to build the hundreds of miles of new wall he has proposed. (Also, it is worth noting that the $1.6 billion Congress allocated to border projects in 2018 is not for the type of giant concrete wall he has proposed: spending on that kind of wall is expressly prohibited in the legislation, and much of the congressional allocation is for replacement and reinforcement projects rather than new construction. The Washington Post reported: \"Of the total, $251 million is earmarked specifically for 'secondary fencing' near San Diego, where fencing is already in place; $445 million is for no more than 25 miles of 'levee fencing'; $196 million is for 'primary pedestrian fencing' in the Rio Grande Valley; $445 million is for the replacement of existing fencing in that area; and the rest is for planning, design and technology -- not for wall construction.\")",

Second, the Mueller investigation was not started because of the research dossier produced by ex-spy Christopher Steele, which Trump calls \"fake.\" Even the famous memo released by House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican, acknowledged that the investigation began before that -- after Papadopoulos boasted to an Australian diplomat that Russia had obtained damaging information on Clinton, before this was publicly known; the Australian diplomat had then passed on the information to U.S. officials. \"The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016,\" the Nunes memo said. In addition, Mueller himself was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was appointed by Trump. Finally, as the Washington Post reported: \"There is no evidence the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application to monitor Carter Page was used to spy on the Trump campaign. On Sept. 26, 2016, Page announced that he was taking 'a leave of absence' from the campaign. On Oct. 21, the FBI received a FISA court order to begin surveillance on Page. So that was just days before the election -- and after Page was no longer part of the campaign.\" In other words, even if there was impropriety in how this initial surveillance warrant was obtained -- and that has not been proven -- there is no current indication that there was surveillance of the campaign itself, since Page had left.",

Reports in the New York Times and elsewhere have revealed that Papadopoulos had boasted to an Australian diplomat that Russia had obtained damaging information on Clinton, before this was publicly known; the Australian diplomat had then passed on the information to U.S. officials. \"The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016,\" the Nunes memo says. With regard to Obama: even some members of the Obama administration take issue with Obama's quiet pre-election response to Russia's election meddling. It is certainly false, though, to suggest Obama didn't do anything at all. In December 2016, after the election, Obama expelled from the U.S. 35 Russian \"diplomats\" suspected of being spies, closed two Russian compounds he alleged were being used for intelligence purposes, and sanctioned Russian intelligence agencies and companies he alleged were providing support to Russian intelligence.",

So as a matter of arithemetics it probably is not the case that any single dealer has caused thousands of deaths,\" Kertesz said. According to federal data crunched by the group Common Sense for Drug Policy, there were 182,048 arrests for the sale or manufacture of drugs in 2016; the U.S. government says that about 64,000 people died of drug overdoses that year.

Further, it is misleading to say \"we don't have the judges.\" No judge on one of the three-judge WTO panels that adjudicate complaints can be from a country involved in the dispute -- so while the U.S. doesn't have the judges, neither do its adversaries.

		"infact": "Democrats have led in all but one of the last 50-plus polls of the \"generic ballot,\" in which respondents are asked, without any candidates' names being mentioned, which party they intend to support in the 2018 midterm elections. We'll let this claim slide, though, because the one recent poll that showed Republicans ahead -- a Politico/Morning Consult poll 39 per cent to 38 per cent -- had just been released a week prior to this tweet. What we won't ignore is the claim that Democrats \"want to do nothing on DACA.\" Trump, a Republican, cancelled the Democrat-created DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program that gives young unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, the \"DREAMers,\" work permits and protection from deportation. Democrats want him to do something to help these people: they are now urging him to simply re-protect DACA enrollees without conditions. Conversely, Trump and other Republicans are demanding steep concessions -- billions of dollars for a border wall, a reduction of one third or more in legal immigration -- in exchange for protecting DACA enrollees, and some conservative Republicans continue to deride any permanent protection for enrollees as \"amnesty.\" Democrats have consented to billions in wall funding, but Trump has rejected even this deal on the grounds that he also wants the cuts to legal immigration. In short: Trump is free to argue, as some DREAMers are, that Democrats are not fighting hard enough for DACA enrollees, but there is no reasonable argument that they \"want to do nothing.",

Donald Trump is telling his supporters that the election is rigged and asking them to monitor certain areas on Election Day.\") Contrary to Trump's suggestion, Democratic officials did not, post-election, abandon Obama's view on voter fraud; nobody important in the party is currently alleging that there was vote-rigging in Trump's favour. Rather, they are noting that, in the view of U.S. intelligence agencies, the Russian government intervened in the election in other ways to assist Trump and hurt Clinton. The allegation of Russian interference was not invented by Democrats post-election; James Clapper, then the director of national intelligence, issued a statement in October 2016, two weeks before Obama's remarks at the press conference, in which Clapper said the U.S. intelligence had concluded Russia was behind the email hacks of Democratic officials: \"The U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from US political organizations...These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\" Finally, it is highly questionable to say that Trump \"easily\" won the Electoral College: though he earned a seemingly comfortable margin of 306 to 232 electoral votes, he did so by prevailing by a razor-slim total of about 107,000 votes in three states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.",

It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?\") Much more importantly, it is false that he was always said the hoax was limited to the specific allegation that his campaign colluded with Russia. In fact, he referred to the overall claim of Russian meddling in the election as a fraud. In Dec. 2016, he had this exchange on Fox News: \"CHRIS WALLACE: According to the Washington Post, the CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the election to help you win the presidency. Your reaction? TRUMP:  I think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it.\" In February 2017, he said, \"I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing -- that's a ruse. That's a ruse.\" He didn't use the word \"hoax,\" but \"ruse\" is almost identical. In Sept. 2016, during the election, he said \"it's probably unlikely\" that Russia was interfering, adding, \"I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out\" -- again, suggesting the very idea of interference was a hoax. And in his most famous remark on the subject, in November 2017, he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin: \"He said he didn't meddle. He said he didn't meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. I just asked him again. He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election. He did not do what they are saying he did... Every time he sees me he says, 'I didn't do that,' and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\"  While he did not himself say \"Russia did not meddle,\" he came very close by saying he really believes Putin \"means\" his denials.",

I don't accept the argument that [the administration] couldn't come out earlier because they hadn't established the evidence of attribution...I also think the process of sanctioning Russia should have begun far earlier, and we should have worked with our European allies to impose costs on Russia.

When services trade with China is included, the overall deficit is usually reduced by tens of billions.

For example, just after Trump announced the tariff, the city of Jacksonville approved a package of about $25 million in incentives for Chinese manufacturer JinkoSolar to open a plant there, leading to Trump-crediting headlines like CNN's \"After Trump tariffs, Chinese solar company says it will build U.S. factory.\" But the timing was coincidence: the company had been pursuing the Jacksonville project well before the tariff announcement; local media reported on the company's incentive request two weeks prior to Trump's announcement. Similarly, in an article titled \"Trump's Tariffs Are Driving a US Solar Panel Resurgence,\" the pro-Trump website LifeZette credited him for a planned expansion by Solaria -- but the company announced that expansion a week and a half prior to Trump's decision.",

At best, for Trump, it suggests that the FBI may have been misleading, by omission, when it asked a court for a warrant to conduct surveillance on a former Trump campaign adviser (Carter Page) who had already left the campaign. The investigation, now being led by special counsel Robert Mueller, is much broader. \"I actually don't think (the memo) has any impact on the Russia probe,\" Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, who described himself as \"pretty integrally involved\" in drafting the memo, told CBS two days after Trump's tweet. He continued: \"To the extent the memo deals with the dossier and the (intelligence surveillance court) process, the dossier has nothing to do with the meeting at Trump Tower. The dossier has nothing to do with an email sent by Cambridge Analytica. The dossier really has nothing to do with George Papadopoulos' meeting in Great Britain. It also doesn't have anything to do with obstruction of justice.\" As Gowdy was suggesting, the question of Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government is far from \"dead.\" Mueller's probe remains active; Mueller, of course, has already secured guilty pleas from two officials from Trump's campaign, Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn, for lying to the FBI about their interactions with Russians.",

(There are possible issues with the report's data itself -- the website The Intercept found that the list of terrorists had been cut by more than 100 people, from a previous version of the list, without any explanation -- but even if you take the numbers as accurate, Trump's framing is inaccurate.)",

		"claim": "Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled.",
		"infact": "Trump did not invent this false claim himself. Rather, he was citing his favourite morning show, Fox and Friends, which appeared to be citing the pro-Trump website Breitbart. But it was incorrect regardless. According to the polling firm Gallup, Trump's approval rating with Black Americans actually fell from 15 per cent to 6 per cent between January 2017 and December 2017, as the Washington Post noted. Recent polls from other firms put Trump's approval rating with Black Americans at a higher level -- 11 per cent in one poll, 12 per cent in another -- but still not even close to double his previous level. So where did Breitbart, Fox and Trump get this claim? They took data from the survey firm SurveyMonkey --  23 per cent Trump approval with black men, 11 per cent approval with Black women -- and simply averaged the figures for the two genders, settling on an \"approval rating\" of 17 per cent. Then they compared that 23 per cent number to Trump's 8 per cent performance with Black Americans in exit polls of the 2016 election. This is erroneous in two ways. First, you cannot properly compare approval rating polls to exit polls; exit polls do not show an approval rating but attempt to reflect how people voted. Second, it is bad math to take a simple average of a politician's male approval rating and female approval rating without considering how many of each were surveyed -- in this case, 19,000 Black men and 31,000 Black women. Trump's actual SurveyMonkey approval rating among all Black Americans. According to the New York Times: \"SurveyMonkey's results...show that Mr. Trump's approval ratings among black Americans actually declined from 20 per cent in February 2017, his first full month in office, to 15 per cent in December.",

(That report estimated $2 trillion in costs up to that point but said the total could rise an additional $4 trillion by 2053.) Trump, however, used the $6 trillion as if it was a current 2016 figure. He later explained that since additional time has elapsed since the campaign, he believes the total is now $7 trillion. That is incorrect. The latest Brown report, issued in late 2017, put the current total at $4.3 trillion, and the total including estimated future costs at $5.6 trillion.",

A Reuters review of mining data shows an industry that has seen only modest gains in jobs and production this year -- much of it from a temporary uptick in foreign demand for U.S. coal rather than presidential policy changes.\" Trump can applaud a slight increase in the employment of people employed in coal mining: it stood at 51,200 in November, 1,500 higher than the number upon Trump's election a year prior. But this was still down more than a third even from its levels in 2012, it can hardly be counted as \"saving\" the industry, and its connection to Trump is tenuous at best. There was an 8 per cent increase in U.S. coal production this year.

Harold Holzer, chairman of the Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation from 2010 to 2016 and before that the chairman of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission for 10 years, said in an email: \"I concede, Trump has cut more regulations than Lincoln did. That's because Lincoln didn't cut ANY regulations and President Trump doesn't know what he's talking about. Might be worth noting that when Lincoln faced a budgetary shortfall he raised taxes, he didn't lower them...imposed the first federal income tax, in fact, and allowed for deductibility of state and local taxes so taxpayers wouldn't be double-taxed (which Trump has now eliminated). If we hear a loud rumbling noise this Christmas season, it's Lincoln rolling over in his grave.\" Said Richard Norton Smith, former executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum: \"It is a curious claim, considering the first income tax and military draft was necessitated by the American Civil War, not to mention the suspension of Habeas Corpus and the ultimate expansion of government power -- to decree an end to slavery and then write it into the Constitution via the Thirteenth Amendment. I guess, then, you could call Abraham Lincoln a 'regulator of human rights.'\" At least one Lincoln scholar found some basis for Trump's claim: Allen Guelzo, professor and director of the Civil War Era Studies Program at Gettysburg College, said: \"...The Homestead Act, by selling-off large portions of the public lands, shrank the operations of the Federal Land Office over time. As the war drew to a close in 1865, Lincoln was extremely eager to begin a build-down of the regulatory apparatus created by the war-effort, and indeed, in terms of the federal budget, that shrank considerably between 1865 and 1871 from $1.9 billion to $424 million.\" Guelzo also noted that Lincoln replaced 1100 of 1500 federal officeholders under his control; he said Trump was probably thinking of the number of \"regulators\" Lincoln displaced. We are not convinced, though, that this is what Trump meant, and it is not clear how Lincoln could be \"right up there\" given the tiny size of the government at the time. \"The body of federal regulations in 1861 was a very small one,\" Guelzo said. \"Most regulatory powers were exercised either by state governments or within the U.S. Military. Only five federal bureaus with regulatory mandates existed at the time.",

The financial crisis was in full swing following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Standard & Poor's 500 index, a popular measure of the U.S. stock market, closed at 805 points on Inauguration Day. Eight years later, the S&P 500 index has risen to 2,274 points after one of the great bull runs in stock market history.",

But his history is off: growth in bank loans to companies boomed in the Obama years after the creation of the Bureau, but it has fallen to lower levels at least preliminarily under Trump. As the Wall Street Journal reported in October: \"Since President Donald Trump's election, bankers and investors predicted that pro-business policies would lead to a surge in corporate borrowing, which would help bank profits. Instead, the growth of loans to companies has dropped precipitously since last November -- to 2.1 per cent from 8.1 per cent, according to Federal Reserve data.\" While some smaller community banks have indeed struggled in recent years, there is no evidence that the Bureau has been a significant cause. The Star contacted three experts who are critical of the Bureau to ask them for their thoughts on the veracity of Trump's claim; the one who responded said the claim is difficult to fact-check because it is so vague. Finally: it's worth noting that a new Bureau rule finalized in October places significant new restrictions on payday lenders, but it has not forced them out of business en masse to date. Even if it had, Trump's claim about \"lenders\" would be overly broad.",

More jobs were created during the same period in 2016, under Obama, than during the first 10 months of Trump's tenure: 1.78 million under Obama, 1.47 million under Trump, Washington Post economics reporter Heather Long noted. Trump presided over two consecutive quarters of 3 per cent economic growth, which is considered good, but as a Brookings Institution report in 2013 noted, the recessions of 1974-1975 and the early 1980s were followed by \"annual GDP growth around 5 per cent in 1976-78 and even higher in 1983-85.\" In short: the economy has performed well under Trump, but it is not experienced a historic uptick.",
